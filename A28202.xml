            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Copy of that <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> had crept to the Preſs. I ſeized and ſtopt it, unwilling to Father other mens Sins.

            <p>AN <hi>Aſſember</hi> is part of the <hi>States</hi> Chattels: nor <hi>Prieſt,</hi> nor <hi>Burgeſs,</hi> but a <hi>Participle</hi> that Sharks upon both. He was choſen, as Sir <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> becauſe he knew leaſt of all his Profeſſion, not by the Votes of a whole Dioceſs, but by one whole Parliament-man. He has ſate four years <hi>towards</hi> a New Religion, but in the interim left None at all. As his Maſters, the <hi>Commons,</hi> had a long Debate <hi>whether Candles or no Candles,</hi> but all the mean while ſate ſtill in the Dark: And therefore when the Moon quits her old Light, and has acquired no new, Aſtronomers ſay ſhe is in her <hi>Synode.</hi> Shew me ſuch a Picture of <hi>Judas</hi> as the <hi>Aſſembler,</hi> (a Griping, Falſe, Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Brother; Rails at <hi>Wast</hi> ſpent upon the <hi>Anointed;</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes moſt thoſe Hands which <hi>Ordain'd</hi> Him; brings in <hi>Men with Swords and Staves;</hi> and all for Money from the Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees:</hi>) One Touch more (a Line tyed to his Name-ſake <hi>Elder-tree</hi>) had made him <hi>Judas</hi> Root and Branch.

When they all meet, they ſhew Beaſts in <hi>Africk,</hi> by promiſcuous coupling ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Monſters. Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> viſits them (as <hi>Perſians</hi> uſe) to ſee <hi>wild Aſſes</hi> ſight: when the <hi>Commons</hi> have tyr'd him with their new Law, theſe Brethren refreſh him with their mad Goſpel. They lately were gravell'd 'twixt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Jericho;</hi> they knew not the diſtance 'twixt thoſe two places; one cry'd Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles, another Ten, 'twas concluded Seven, for this reaſon, that <hi>Fiſh was brought from</hi> Jericho <hi>to</hi> Jeruſalem-<hi>Market:</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſmil'd, and ſaid, <hi>perhaps the Fiſh was ſalt Fiſh,</hi> and ſo ſtopp'd their mouths. Earl <hi>Philip</hi> goes thither to hear them <hi>ſpend;</hi> when he heard them toſs their NATIONAL, PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINCIAL, CLASSICAL, CONGREGATIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL; he ſwore <hi>damnably,</hi> that a Pack of good Dogs made better Muſick: His Alluſion was proper, ſince the <hi>Elder</hi>'s <hi>Maid</hi> had a four-legg'd Husband. To ſpeak truth, this <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> is the <hi>two Houſes</hi> Tiring-Room, where the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> put on their Viſards and Maſques of Religion.

They have lately publiſhed ANNOTATIONS on the Bible, where their firſt Note
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48248:4"/>
(on the word <hi>CREATE</hi>) is a Libel againſt Kings for cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of Honours. Their <hi>Annotation</hi> on <hi>Jacob</hi>'s two Kids, is, that <hi>two Kids are too much for one man's Supper:</hi> but <hi>he had</hi> (ſay they) <hi>but one Kid, and the other made Sauce.</hi> They obſerve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Herod,</hi> what a Tyrant he was, to kill Infants under two years old, <hi>without giving them a Legal Trial</hi> that they might ſpeak for themſelves. Commonly they follow the <hi>Geneva</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, as thoſe Sea-men, who underſtood not the <hi>Compaſs</hi> crept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Shore. But I hear they threaten a <hi>ſecond Edition,</hi> and in the interim thruſt forth a Paultry <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> which expounds Nine <hi>Commandments,</hi> and Eleven Articles of the <hi>Creed.</hi> Of late they are much in love with <hi>Chronograms,</hi> becauſe (if poſſible) they are duller than <hi>Anagrams;</hi> O how they have torn the poor Biſhops names to pick out the Number of 666! little dreaming that a whole Bakers dozen of their own <hi>Aſſembly</hi> have that Beaſtly Number in each of their Names, and that as exactly as their <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> conſiſts of 666 Words. But though the <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> Brains are Lead, his Countenance is Braſs; for he Damn'd ſuch as held Two Benefices, while himſelf has Four or Five, beſides his Concubine-<hi>Lecture.</hi> He is not againſt <hi>Pluralities,</hi> but <hi>Dualities;</hi> He ſays 'tis unlawful to have Two of his own, though Four of other mens; and obſerves how the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for <hi>Life</hi> has no Singular number. Yet 'tis ſome Relief to a Sequeſter'd Perſon to ſee two <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> ſnarl for his Tyths; for of all kind of Beaſts none can match an <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler,</hi> but an <hi>Aſſembler.</hi> He never enters a Church by the Door, but clambers up through a Window of <hi>Sequeſtration,</hi> or ſteals in through Vaults and Cellars by Clandeſtine Contracts with an Expecting Patron.

A man would think the <hi>Two Houſes</hi> intended to <hi>tranſport</hi> the <hi>Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> ſince they load Aſſes with College-Revenues. For though theſe <hi>Aſſemblers</hi> made themſelves <hi>Heads,</hi> they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Hands</hi> of Colleges, for they all are Takers, and take all; and yet they are ſuch creeping Tyrants, that Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are Expelled the two <hi>Univerſities,</hi> as the old <hi>Thracians,</hi> forc'd from their Country, by Rats and Mice. So that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now is ſo much advanced, as <hi>Arrow-ſmith's</hi> Glaſs-eye ſees more than his Natural. They never admit a good Scholar to a <hi>Benefice;</hi> for the <hi>Aſſembly</hi>'s Balance is the <hi>Lake</hi> of <hi>Sodom,</hi> where Iron ſwims, and Feathers ſink.

This made him curſe Dr. <hi>Steward,</hi> Dr. <hi>Laney,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond;</hi> and had he not had more Braſs in his Face than in his Kitchin, he had hang'd himſelf at <hi>Uxbridge,</hi> and ended with that <hi>Treaty.</hi> For he has nought of <hi>Logick,</hi> but her <hi>clutcht fiſt;</hi> and rails at <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as Beggars do at Gentlemen.

When it rain's he is Choak'd (a <hi>Claſſis</hi> of them together) row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Eyes to mark who beholds him. His ſhorteſt things are his Hair and his Cloak. His Hair is cut to the figure of 3. two high Cliffs run up his Temples, whoſe Cape of ſhorn hair ſhoot's down his Forehead, with Creeks indented, where his Ears ride at Anchor. Had this falſe Prophet been carried with <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> had caught faſt hold of his <hi>Ears,</hi> and led Him as He leads his Auditory. His Eyes are part of his Tithe at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which he boyles at each Sermon. He has two Mouths, his Noſe is one, for he ſpeaks through both. His Hands are not in his Gloves, but his Gloves in his Hands; for 'twixt Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that is, Sermons, he handles little elſe, except his dear <hi>Mammon.</hi> His Gown (I mean his Cloak) reaches but his Pockets: when he rides in that Mantle, with a Hood on his Shoulders and a Hat above both, is he not then his own <hi>Man of Sin</hi> with the <hi>Tripple Crown?</hi> you would ſwear ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Carpenter dreſs'd him, and made him the Tunnel of a Countrey Chimney. His Doublet and Hoſe are of dark Blew, a grain deeper than pure <hi>Coventry:</hi> but of late he's in Black, ſince the Loyal Clergy were Perſecuted into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. His two longeſt things are his <hi>Nayles</hi> and his <hi>Prayer.</hi> But the cleaneſt thing about him is his Pulpit-Cuſhion, for he ſtill beats the Duſt out of it. To do him Right, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he wears a pair of good Lungs, whereby he turns the Church into a Belfry, for his Clapper makes ſuch a Din, you cannot hear the <hi>Cymball</hi> for the <hi>Tinkling.</hi> If his Pulpit be Large, he walks his Round, and ſpeaks as from a Garriſon, (his own Neck is Palizado'd with Ruff.) When he firſt enters his Prayer before Sermon, he winks and gaſps, and gaſps and winks, as if he prepared to Preach in another World: He ſeems in a Slumber, then in a Dream; then rumbles a while; at laſt he ſounds forth, and then throws ſo much Dirt and Non-Senſe towards Heaven, as he durſt not offer to a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament. Now becauſe Scripture bids him <hi>not Curſe the King in his Thought,</hi> he do's it in his Pulpit by Word of Mouth; though Heaven ſtrike him Dumb in the very Act, as it did <hi>Hill</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who while he Pray'd, <hi>Depoſe

For his only hope why God ſhould hear him againſt the <hi>King,</hi> is the Devil himſelf (that great <hi>Aſſembler</hi>) was heard againſt <hi>Job.</hi> His whole Prayer is ſuch an irrational Bleating that (without a Metaphor) 'tis the <hi>Calves of his Lips:</hi> And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly 'tis Larded with fine new words, as <hi>Savingable, Much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Chriſt-Jeſuſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. and yet he has the face to Preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Prayer in an unknown Tongue.</hi> Sometimes he's Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, and then there is ſuch hideous Coughing! But that's very ſeldom, for he can glibly run over Non-ſenſe, as an empty Cart trundles down a Hill. When the <hi>King</hi> girt round the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> at <hi>Leſtythiell,</hi> an <hi>Aſſembler</hi> complain'd that <hi>God had drawn his People into the Wilderneſs,</hi> and told Him, <hi>he was bound in Honour to feed them; for, Lord,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſince thou giveſt them no Meat, we pray thee, O Lord, to give them no Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs.</hi> He tore the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> becauſe, forſooth, it ſhackl'd his Spirit, (he would be a <hi>Devil</hi> without a <hi>Circle;</hi>) and now if he ſee the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> the Fire ſees it next, as ſure as the Biſhops were burn'd who compil'd it. Yet he has Mercy on <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Sternhold,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Meeters</hi> are ſung without Authority (no Statute, Canon, or Injunction at all;) only, like himſelf, firſt crept into private Houſes, and then into Churches. Mr. <hi>Rous</hi> mov'd thoſe <hi>Meeters</hi> might be Sequeſtred, and his own new Rithmes to enjoy the Sequeſtration; but was Refuſed, becauſe <hi>John Hopkins</hi> was as ancient as <hi>John Calvin;</hi> Beſides, when <hi>Rous</hi> ſtood forth for his Trial, <hi>Robin Wiſdom</hi> was found the better Poet. 'Tis true they have a <hi>Directory,</hi> but 'tis good for nothing but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniram,</hi> who ſold the Original for 400 <hi>l.</hi> And the Book muſt ſerve both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as the <hi>Directory Needle</hi> points <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi> The <hi>Aſſembler's</hi> only Ingenuity is, that he prays for an <hi>ex tempore</hi> Spirit, ſince his Conſcience tells him he has no Learning. His Prayer thus ended, he then looks round, to obſerve the Sex of his Congregation, and accordingly turns the Apoſtles, <hi>Men, Fathers, and Brethren</hi> into <hi>Dear Brethren and Siſters.</hi> For, his uſual Auditory is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48248:7"/>
moſt part <hi>Female;</hi> and as many Siſters flock to Him, as at <hi>Paris</hi> on St. <hi>Margarets</hi> day, when all come to Church that are or hope to be with Child that year. He divides his Text as he did the Kingdom, makes one part fight againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or as <hi>Burgeſs</hi> divides the Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Houſe, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Parts,</hi> but <hi>Tenements,</hi> that is, ſo as 'twill yield the moſt Money. And properly they are <hi>Tenements;</hi> for each Part muſt be <hi>dwelt</hi> upon, though himſelf comes near it but once a <hi>Quarter;</hi> and ſo his Text is rather <hi>Let out</hi> than <hi>Divided.</hi> Yet ſometimes (to ſhew his skill in <hi>Keckerman,</hi>) he <hi>Butchers</hi> a Text, cuts it (juſt as the <hi>Levite</hi> did his <hi>Concubine</hi>) into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dead Parts, breaking the Senſe and Words all to pieces; and then they are not <hi>Divided,</hi> but <hi>Shatter'd,</hi> like the Splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Don Quixot</hi>'s Launce. If his Text be to the Occaſion, his firſt Diſh is <hi>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver;</hi> yet tells not the People what <hi>Pictures</hi> thoſe were. His Sermon and Prayer grin at each other, though one is <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and the other <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent;</hi> for he Preaches up the <hi>Claſſes,</hi> yet prays for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> Let his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> be what they will, his <hi>Uſe</hi> is ſtill to ſave his <hi>Benefice</hi> and augment his <hi>Lecture.</hi> He talks much of <hi>Truth,</hi> but abhors <hi>Peace,</hi> leſt it ſtrip him as <hi>naked</hi> as <hi>Truth;</hi> and therefore hates a <hi>Perſonal Treaty,</hi> unleſs with a Siſter. He has a rare ſimpring way of expreſſion; he calls a Married Couple, <hi>Saints that enjoy the Myſtery;</hi> and a man Drunk, is <hi>a Brother full of the Creature.</hi> Yet at Wedding Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons he is very familiar, and (like that Picture in the Church at <hi>Leyden</hi>) ſhews <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> without <hi>Fig-leaves.</hi> At Funerals, he gives infallible Signs that the Party is gone to Heaven; but his chief Mark of a <hi>child of God,</hi> is <hi>to be good to Gods Miniſters.</hi> And hence 'tis he calls his Preachment, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> fitted not to his Hearers <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> but their <hi>Palat;</hi> for 'tis to feed himſelf, not them. If he chance to tire, he refreſhes himſelf with the Peoples <hi>Hum,</hi> as a Collar of Bells do chear up a Pack-horſe. 'Tis no wonder he'll Preach, but that any will hear him; and his conſtant Auditors do but ſhew the length of their Ears;) For he is ſuch an <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that to hear him, makes good Scholars ſick; but to

read him, is death. Yet though you hear him three hours, he'll ask a fourth; as the Beggar at <hi>Delph</hi> craves your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>becauſe he eats four pound of Bread at a Meal.</hi> 'Twas from his Larrum the <hi>Watch-makers</hi> learned their <hi>infinite Skrew.</hi> His Glaſs and Text are equally handled, that is, once an hour: nay, ſometimes he ſally's and never returns, and then we ſhould leave him to the Company of <hi>Lorimers,</hi> for he muſt be held with Bit and Bridle. Who ever once has been at his Church can never doubt the Hiſtory of <hi>Balaam.</hi> If he have got any new Tale or Expreſſion, 'tis eaſier to make Stones ſpeak than him to hold his peace. He hates a Church where there is an <hi>Eccho,</hi> for it robs him of his dear <hi>Repetition,</hi> and confounds the Auditory as well as he. But of all Mortals I admire the <hi>Short-hand-men,</hi> who have the Patience to write from his Mouth: had they the Art to ſhorten it into Senſe, they might write his whole Sermon on the back of their Nail. For his Invention conſiſts in finding a way to ſpeak Nothing upon any thing; and were he in the <hi>Grand Seigniors</hi> power, he would lodge him with his <hi>Mutes;</hi> for <hi>Nothing</hi> and <hi>Nothing to purpoſe</hi> are all one. I wonder in Conſcience he can Preach againſt <hi>Sleeping</hi> at his <hi>Opium</hi>-Sermons. He Preaches indeed both in Seaſon and out of Seaſon; for he rails at Popery, when the Land is almoſt loſt in Presbytery; and would cry out <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> in <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Flood.</hi> Yet all this he ſo acts with his Hands, that in this ſence too his Preaching is a <hi>Handicraft.</hi> Nor can we complain that <hi>Plays</hi> are put down while he can Preach, ſave only his <hi>Sermons</hi> have worſe Senſe and leſs Truth. But he Blew down the <hi>Stage,</hi> and Preach'd up the <hi>Scaffold.</hi> And very wiſely, leſt men ſhould track him, and find where he pilfers all his beſt <hi>Similes,</hi> (the only thing wherein he is commendable, St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf having cull'd Sentences from <hi>Meander</hi>'s <hi>THAIS,</hi> though 'twas his worſt, that is, unchaſt Comedy.) Sometimes the <hi>Aſsembler</hi> will venture at the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and then (with the Tranſlator of <hi>Don Quixot</hi>) he miſtakes <hi>Sobs and Sighs</hi> for <hi>Eggs and Collops.</hi> But commonly (for want of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>) he learns <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and ſtreight is <hi>illuminated;</hi> that is, mad; his Brain is broke by a Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat

caſt from the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> And yet this empty win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Teacher has <hi>Lectur'd</hi> a War quite round the Kingdom: he has found a <hi>Circulation of Blood</hi> for <hi>Deſtruction</hi> (as famous <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi> for <hi>Preſervation</hi> of Mankind.) 'Twas eaſier to foreſee a great Mortality when Ravens were heard in all <hi>Corporations.</hi> For, as Multitudes of Frogs preſage a Peſtilence, ſo croaking <hi>Lectures</hi> foretold an <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> Men come to Church, as the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> went to Sacrifice, led by Crows. You have ſeen a ſmall <hi>Elder tree</hi> grow in Chinks and Clefts of Church-walls; it ſeems rather a <hi>Weed</hi> than a <hi>Tree;</hi> which, lend it growth, makes a Rent in the Wall, and throws down the Church. Is not this the <hi>Aſſembler?</hi> grown from Schiſms (which himſelf begot,) and if permitted, will make the Church but a <hi>Floor,</hi> or <hi>Church-yard.</hi> Yet, for all this, he will be called <hi>Christs Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Saint,</hi> as the Rebels againſt King <hi>John</hi> were <hi>the Army of God.</hi> Sure when they meet, they cannot but ſmile; for the dulleſt among them muſt needs know that they all cheat the People: ſuch groſs low Impoſtors, that we die the death of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> Poyſon'd by <hi>Muſhromes.</hi> The old Hereticks had Skill and Learning (ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for a Seduced Church;) Thoſe were <hi>Scholars,</hi> but theſe are <hi>Aſſemblers;</hi> whoſe very Brains (as <hi>Manichaeus</hi>'s skin) are ſtuffed with <hi>Chaff.</hi> For they Study little, and Preach much, ever ſick of a <hi>Diabete:</hi> nor do they <hi>read,</hi> but <hi>weed</hi> Authors, picking up cheap and refuſe Notes, that with <hi>Caligula</hi> they gather Cockle-ſhells, and with <hi>Domitian</hi> retire into their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to catch Flies.
